After evaluating the results of 100 queries from Google and Bing, two key metrics are calculated. The average percent overlap is 18.5%, and the average Spearman coefficient is around -5.64.

The low average percent overlap of 18.5% indicates that Bing’s results are not highly aligned with Google’s results. The highly negative average Spearman coefficient of -5.64 indicates that the ranking orders of the two search engines are inversely correlated. 

From the statistics, we can conclude that the two search engines yield quite different results and rank those results differently for the same queries. However, whether Bing performs significantly better or worse than Google cannot be determined solely from these metrics. Further analysis of the quality and relevance of the results is necessary to draw a more definitive conclusion about which search engine is superior.
